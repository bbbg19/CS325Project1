## Synopsis

This program has a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm.  Both algorithms are used to find the number of coins to make a certain amount of change for a given set of coin denominations.

## Running the Program

To run the program, type 'python Project2.py [filename]' where [filename] is the name of the file containing the data you wish to use for this program.  If you wish to use a file named 'Coin1.txt', type 'python Project2.py Coin1' and it will open the file named Coin1.txt.  The output will be in a file named '[filename] change.txt' where it would be 'Coin1 change.txt' for the example given earlier.  The output will be presented first for the greedy algorithm followed by the dynamic programing algorithm.
