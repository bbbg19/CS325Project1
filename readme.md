## Synopsis

This program finds the maximum sum subarray (MSS) from a given array.  It uses four different algorithms to find this MSS to compare the run times of the algorithms.

## Tests

Inside of a file titled 'MSS_Problems.txt' have at least one list such as A = [1, 2, 3, 4]:
The program will call enumeration(A), betterEnumeration(A), getMSS(A), or linear(A) to find the MSS for each list in the input file.
The output will be saved in a file called 'MSS_Results.txt'
